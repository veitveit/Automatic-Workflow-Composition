# Automatic-Workflow-Composition

Collection of material including data files, scripts, workflows and results for the proteomics use cases described in the publication "Automated workflow composition from a pool of bioinformatics tools: a demonstration for mass spectrometry data analysis" (in preparation).

The workflows of the four use cases are easily executed within the given Docker container. However, the bash scripts can also be adapted to run independently by adjusting the paths of the used software tools (if available on the respective computer).
